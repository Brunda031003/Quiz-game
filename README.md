This project is a simple Python quiz game. The game has 5 questions on a variety of topics, and the player is rewarded 1 point for every correct answer.
The code starts by printing a welcome message and asking the player if they want to start the game. If the player says yes, the game begins.

The player is then presented with a series of questions, and the code checks their answers to see if they are correct. If the player's answer is correct, they are given a point. If the player's answer is incorrect, they are told the correct answer.

After the player has answered all of the questions, the code displays their score.
